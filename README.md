<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: How to Deploy on-premises Active Directory within Azure Compute](https://youtu.be/e2XLFqdsGuM)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

- Prepare the Server
- Install Active Directory Domain Services
- Promote the Server to a Domain Controller
- Create Organizational Units

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>
In high-level deployment and configuration, you prepared the server, installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), and promoted the server to a domain controller. You configured DNS for domain resolution, created Organizational Units (OUs) to organize users and resources, and added users, groups, and assigned permissions. You also set up Group Policies for security and user management, followed by testing and monitoring the system to ensure proper functionality. This process establishes and configures Active Directory for effective network and resource management.
